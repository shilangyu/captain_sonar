# Captain Sonar digital helper

Digital helper for the captain sonar board game.

- Radar: tracking possible opponent positions (TODO: tracking mines)
- Navigation: suggests moves that are least revealing (TODO)
- Intel: suggests best questions to ask (TODO)
- Attack: suggests best attacks (TODO)

## Does it not ruin the fun of the game?

Yes. This was created because with a friend we want to put our digital helpers head to head.
